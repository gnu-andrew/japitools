<h1>japitools: Java API compatibility testing tools</h1>
<p>japitools consists of two simple tools designed to test for compatibility
between Java APIs. They were originally designed for testing free
implementations of Java itself for compatibility with Sun's JDK, but they can
also be used for testing backward compatibility between versions of any API.</p>
<p>The tools are <a href="#japize">japize</a>
and <a href="#japicompat">japicompat</a>. Japize is a Java program which
uses the jode.bytecode library to emit a listing of an API in a machine-readable
format. Japicompat then takes two such listings and compares them for binary
compatibility, as defined by Sun in the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/13.doc.html">Java Language Specification</a>
(and as amended
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/clarify.html">here</a>).</p>
<h3>Authors</h3>
<p>japitools was written primarily by
<a href="http://sab39.dev.netreach.com/">Stuart Ballard (sab39)</a>.
Contributions have been made by various people including Brian Jones,
Tom Tromey, Michael Koch and Jeroen Frijters. It incorporates part of Jode by
Jochen Hoenicke. If I forgot anyone,

<p>Previously, the <a href="http://wonka.acunia.com/wonka.html">Wonka</a> VM was
also included in this list, but they seem to have stopped providing japi files
some time ago, so they have been removed.</p>
<p>A tarball of the JDK japi files used to generate this output can be
downloaded from <a href="jdkjapis.tar">here</a>. These japi files were
created by running japize over the rt.jar (or equivalent) files from each
JDK release.</p>

<ul>
  <li>XX November 2004: Released japitools-0.9.5. This release adds a
      much-requested feature: the ability to ignore differences when reporting
	  compatibility with an early API release, if those differences are
	  required for compatibility with a later release. See the description of
	  the -i flag below for more information. This new code has been running
	  nightly for a while producing the results linked above, without any known
	  problems. It reveals that the free implementations are much closer to full
	  coverage of 1.0 and 1.1 than was previously apparent - in fact missing only
	  three fields from java.awt.Font for 1.0 coverage and only slightly more for
	  1.1.<br>
	  Thanks to Michael Koch for the key insight that enabled this feature to
	  finally be written, after four years of me saying it was needed.<br>
	  Also in this release is a fix from Jeroen Frijters for methods in final
	  classes that were not explicitly marked final themselves, and the
	  serialize and serialcompat tools have been removed (they are now a module
	  in the <a href="?">Mauve</a> project).
	  </li>
  <li>30 September 2004: Released japitools-0.9.4. This is a bugfix release
      that addresses two issues:
      <ul>
        <li>Constant field values were frequently missed.</li>
        <li>Exceptions were sometimes misreported (found and fixed by Tom
            Tromey).</li>
      </ul>
      Needless to say, the world has changed a bit since I suggested that
      0.9.3 was a release candidate for 1.0. Now that Java 5 has been released,
      it would be unacceptable to make a 1.0 release without support for
      generics and the other new language features. Still, 0.9.4 is definitely
      more stable than any previous "stable" release - this is the version
      you should be using.
  </li>
  <li>19 February 2003: Released japitools-0.9.3. This is a 'release candidate'
      for 1.0. There are a few minor fixes over 0.9.2 including:
      <ul>
        <li>Workaround a bug that caused Japize to abort when run against
            Classpath.</li>
        <li>Implement toString-independent comparisons of floats and doubles,
            as described below.</li>
        <li>Fix a problem that caused deprecation errors to be reported only on
            classes and interfaces, not members.</li>
        <li>Fix an erroneous '}' that appeared in comparisons of constant
            fields. Also fix some other potential problems if particular
            characters appeared in constant fields.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>4 December 2002: Released an EXPERIMENTAL, BETA QUALITY japitools-0.9.2.
      This release is more complete than 0.9.1 and includes some fixes over
      version 0.9 that make it worth using even if you're not interested in
      the flashy output. On the other hand, it's still less tested than 0.9
      was, so be warned. Improvements over 0.9.1 include:
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for a problem that caused inner classes to be incorrectly
            treated as non-static.</li>
        <li>Deprecation support (<em>un</em>deprecating an API is flagged as a
            (minor) error).</li>
        <li>Preparation for toString-independent comparisons of floats and
            doubles. Since toString on these types seems to be all but
            impossible to code to the spec (even Sun don't achieve it), this
            allows japi files to be somewhat independent of the VM producing
            them. Note that this is not yet implemented in japicompat, but
            the necessary information is in the japi file so the nightly results
            will be able to take advantage immediately.</li>
        <li>The date of japi file creation is now included in the japi file and
            presented in the output</li>
        <li>Numerous fixes to the HTML output including better organization of
            errors, browser compatibility fixes, and a color-legend.</li>
        <li>Parallel enhancements to the text output.</li>
        <li>Use -h to get HTML output, no more piping to japiohtml manually.
            You can still get raw output by specifying -j. Use -o to specify
            an output filename if you don't want to use shell redirection.</li>
        <li>Other miscellaneous fixes.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>21 November 2002: Released an EXPERIMENTAL, ALPHA QUALITY japitools-0.9.1.
      Japitools-0.9 is still the recommended version if you plan to do anything
      important with the results. This release includes some nice new features
      but also has some significant issues:
      <ul>
        <li>The documentation below has not been updated to cover this release.
            Since 0.9 is still the stable version, I need to split out the
            webpage with separate docs for each version. I haven't done that
            yet. The only information about the differences in usage is this
            list.</li>
        <li>japicompat no longer gives you anything terribly comprehensible if
            you save its stdout directly. Instead, you must pipe the output to
            one of the new tools japiotext or japiohtml. In a future version
            this will be made optional, with a pipe through japiotext as the
            default, but currently it's compulsory. You can save the results
            as a ".japio" file if you want to run both japiotext and japiohtml
            over the same output.</li>
        <li>Speaking of which, the japiohtml tool gives nice HTML output. This
            is what's been generating the nightly classpath comparisons. The
            output will be further cleaned up in future versions.</li>
        <li>Using japiotext to get text output still doesn't provide everything
            the old text output did. Neither does the HTML output.</li>
        <li>The bits of Jode source code that I'm using are included directly
            and get compiled into japitools.jar, so jode-1.1.1.jar is no longer
            bundled. I stripped out some of the "magic" of the Jode build system
            to use just .java files instead of .java.in. I also applied a
            theoretical fix to Jode's problem with JDK1.4, but this is entirely
            untested. If you test it, and produce a jdk14.japi.gz, please
            send it to me.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>13 November 2002: Started a nightly script comparing classpath to various
      JDK versions using new experimental (and unreleased because it's still
      very crufty) HTML output. The results can be seen here:
      <a href="htmlout/h-jdk11-classpath.html">vs JDK1.1</a>,
      <a href="htmlout/h-jdk12-classpath.html">vs JDK1.2</a>, and
      <a href="htmlout/h-jdk13-classpath.html">vs JDK1.3</a>.</li>
  <li>5 November 2002: Released japitools-0.9, and dared to announce it on a few
      mailing lists that I thought might be interested. This release only has
      minor changes and cleanups over 0.8.7:
      <ul>
        <li>Japifix was missing a case in the exception-pruning algorithm
            (thanks to Brian Jones for catching this).</li>
        <li>Fixes to serialize from Brian Jones, including addition of the
            line that actually runs it, which I somehow missed last time.</li>
        <li>Print a warning from japize about the importance of using the right
            filename, if "as" isn't used (thanks to Dalibor Topic for pointing
            out that this isn't obvious). Updated the docs, too.</li>
        <li>Cleaner separation of japicompat output between stdout and stderr,
            to make it easier to redirect what you actually want. Recommended
            usage is now to redirect stdout only, and use the "-q" option if
            running non-interactively.</li>
      </ul>
      This release is currently considered stable and suitable for widespread
      use. Barring the discovery of major problems, the next few releases will
      be potentially unstable new-feature releases leading up to an eventual
      1.0.</li>
  <li>24 September 2002: Released japitools-0.8.7, which is a "release
      candidate" for a hopefully stable and widely-announced 0.9. Quite a bit
      new in this release:
      <ul>
        <li>Japize (and japifix) will now ignore any subclasses of Error and
            RuntimeException thrown, because they're redundant. Exceptions will
            also be skipped if they are subclasses of another exception thrown
            by the same method, eg FileNotFoundException won't be included if
            the method also throws IOException.</li>
        <li>Added Ant build system (optional) provided by Brian Jones.</li>
        <li>Added new tools serialize and serialcompat for testing serialization
            compatibility, again thanks to Brian Jones.</li>
        <li>japipkgs has evolved into japilist, which can list classes and
            members, and filter results by package and class, as well as just
            listing packages. Thanks again to Brian for the "japiclasses" script
            that inspired this tool.</li>
        <li>japifix can now detect mis-sorted files without the explicit -s
            flag, by re-starting as soon as a mis-sort is detected. To make this
            possible, the ability to operate on stdin has been dropped.</li>
        <li>Fixed a corner-case mis-sorting bug in japize that appeared if
            java.lang.something was included but java.lang itself was not.</li>
        <li>japicompat flushes stdout when it's done, making the output appear
            in a nice order if stdout and stderr are redirected to the same
            place.</li>
        <li>Added windows batch file for running japize on windows systems,
            thanks (yet again :) ) to Brian Jones.</li>
        <li>Added the <a href="japi-spec.txt">japi file format specification</a>
            for the benefit of anyone writing code to interoperate with
            japitools.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>18 September 2002: Released japitools-0.8.6, fixing an ordering problem
      related to inner classes (serve me right for having a machine that can
      only handle japizing JDK1.1, which has no inner classes). This release
      also includes some cruft-removal, including the unreliable "reflect"
      option and japicompat-old, and makes zipped output the default. I added
      Jode to the tarball itself and restructured a bit so that japize can find
      its own libraries, so you no longer need to set CLASSPATH (or download
      Jode separately).</li>
  <li>10 September 2002: Released japitools-0.8.5. This fixes numerous problems
      in the files produced by japize, bringing it finally back to parity with
      release 0.8 or so. Japicompat will now abort on mis-ordered files, so that
      errors like this will be caught quicker next time. Japi2new got a facelift
      and is now called japifix. Much more testing, leading me to conclude that
      japicompat is now <em>more</em> trustworthy than japicompat-old.</li>
  <li>31 July 2002: Released a brown-paper-bag japitools-0.8.4 with a fix for
      a hang-at-end-of-file bug that showed up whenever the 'orig' file contains
      packages or classes at the end of the file that aren't in the 'new' file.
      Oooops!</li>
  <li>31 July 2002: Released japitools-0.8.3 with a rewritten japicompat that
      uses a much faster and more scalable algorithm. Of course, being a total
      rewrite, there's a risk of regressions, so the old japicompat is still
      available as japicompat-old (and, in fact, includes a fix or two over the
      0.8.2 version). The other casualty of the rewrite is that although some
      summary information is better, some is also worse. I hope to resurrect the
      bits of what was lost that make sense. Also updated the docs below so that
      they match the state of reality since 0.8.1.</li>
  <li>9 July 2002: Released japitools-0.8.2 with a fix for a NullPointer.
      There's more work in progress on my laptop that isn't included in this
      release because it's not ready yet, but hopefully soon there'll be a first
      pass at the optimized algorithm for japicompat.</li>
  <li>28 June 2002: Released japitools-0.8.1. Noted that this obsoletes some
      of the documentation on the website. Removed a bunch of old results
      files that aren't correct any more. The docs will have to be updated
      later - no time now.</li>
  <li>19 March 2002: Updated the website so that the documentation matches the
      actual current code. Since it's been almost 2 years since I wrote this,
      I can't be 100% sure that this documentation is all correct, but it's
      certainly better than it was before!</li>
  <li>28 June 2000: Finally bundled japitools up into a jarball which I'm
      calling version 0.8 (which is a good indicator of how close to "complete"
      I feel it is). It now requires the jode.bytecode package if you want to
      get good results, although you can still use the old buggy reflection
      version. See below for details.</li>
  <li>18 June 2000: At the suggestion of Edouard G. Parmelan, added support
      for checking SerialVersionUIDs. Since this will generally produce lots
      of errors and make it harder to identify more important API compatibility
      errors, it needs to be explicitly turned on in japicompat by passing the
      -v flag.</li>
  <li>16 June 2000: Godmar fixed the remaining Kaffe bug, so I've removed the
      hackaround. I still need to leave part of it in due to a subtlety in the
      way superinterfaces are defined by the JLS. japicompat now removes
      duplicates, cutting the number of Kaffe errors to 142, and checks
      everything in the JLS plus my four additions. Reflection is incapable of
      telling me if a field is a primitive constant, buggrit, so I have to
      move to using something like gnu.bytecode.</li>
  <li>15 June 2000: Japize is now, finally, well commented. Godmar Back kindly
      fixed one of the Kaffe bugs which will mean that some hackarounds can be
      removed Real Soon (once another related bug gets fixed). I've been hacking
      japicompat to allow duplicates to be removed; you can find the code
      <a href="japicompat2.pl">here</a> [long-dead link]. It doesn't actually <b>do</b> the
      removal yet, but the architecture is in. This will replace japicompat once
      I'm convinced it's as robust; early signs look good. It's also commented!
      Certify me on <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/sab39">Advogato</a>
      - or don't, but it really is me! I need to figure how I'm going to version
      japitools - right now, all the links here are to my working copies...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You can download <a href="japitools-0.9.5.tar.gz">japitools-0.9.5.tar.gz</a>
here. This tarball contains a bin/ directory containing all the japi tools, a
share/ directory containing the java runtime libraries, and a src/ directory
containing all the sources in case you want to do development. It should be
unnecessary to set your CLASSPATH, since japitools can figure out the path to
its runtime libraries by relative directory structures.</p>
<p>The tarball contains code extracted from
<a href="http://jode.sourceforge.net/">Jode</a>
(a jarball of which is mirrored <a href="jode-1.1.1.jar">here</a>).
japitools is completely self-sufficient (except for perl, Java, and optionally
gzip). The tools in the bin directory assume that perl is /usr/bin/perl and that
your prefered Java runtime is "java" in your PATH. If you're working with
zipped japi files, you must also have "gzip" in your path.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Using japitools is a two-step process:</p>
<ul><li>Use japize to generate a .japi file for each of the versions you want
to compare.</li>
<li>Use japicompat to compare one for backwards compatibility with the
other</li></ul>
<h4><a name="japize">japize</a></h4>
<p>The general usage of japize is as follows:</p>
<pre>$ japize [unzip] [as &lt;name&gt;] apis &lt;zipfile&gt; | &lt;dir&gt; ... +|-&lt;pkgpath&gt; ...</pre>
<p>At least one +&lt;pkgpath&gt; is required. &lt;name&gt; will have
".japi" and/or ".gz" appended as appropriate.</p>
<p>The word "apis" can be replaced by "explicitly", "byname", "packages" or
"classes". These options indicate whether something of the form "a.b.C" should
be treated as a class or a package. You may specify this unambiguously by using
one of the forms "a.b.cpackage," or "a.b,CClass".</p>
<p>That's the one-paragraph overview, pretty much equivalent to what you get if
you type "japize" with no arguments. In detail, the options available are as
follows:</p>
<h4>[unzip]</h4>
<p>Specifying the "unzip" option indicates that japize should not gzip its
output. Zipping the output is highly
recommended since it saves huge amounts of space (japi files are
large but extremely compressable because they contain large numbers of duplicate
strings. Factor-of-ten compression seems to be typical). The only situations
where you might not want to use gzip compression are when memory and CPU usage
are extremely tight (zipping and unzipping both require more memory the larger
the file gets, and require more CPU usage - on todays computers this is rarely
an issue, though) or if your JVM does not implement GZIPOutputStream correctly
(in which case you might still want to gzip the resulting file manually).</p>
<h4>as &lt;name&gt;</h4>
<p>Specifying this option tells japize to write its output to a file with the
specified name. When writing to a file with the "as" option, japize insists on
writing to a file name ending in .japi.gz for compressed files, or .japi for
uncompressed files. If the filename you specify doesn't have the right
extension, japize will add parts to it to ensure that it does.</p>
<p>If the "as" option is omitted, japize will write to standard output. In this
case japize has no control over the filename you use, but it is strongly
recommended to use a filename with the correct extension (".japi.gz" unless the
"unzip" option was specified). If you use any other extension, japicompat and
other tools may be unable to recognize the format.</p>
<h4>apis | explicitly | byname | packages | classes</h4>
<p>This option has a dual role: it indicates the boundary between japize options
(unzip, as) and other arguments (files and packages), but also tells
japize how to deal with ambiguously specified arguments. See
"+|-&lt;pkgpath&gt;" below for details on the behavior of each option. If you
are unsure which to specify, "apis" is a safe choice.</p>
<h4>&lt;zipfile&gt; | &lt;dir&gt;</h4>
<p>Any arguments after "apis" that do not start with "+" or "-" are taken to be
zipfiles or directories. These should be specified exactly as you would put
them in your CLASSPATH (except separated by spaces rather than colons). Anything
that's a file will be assumed to be a zip (or jar) file, so you can't specify
a .class file directly - if you need to do that you should specify the folder
containing it and then name the class for processing.</p>
<h4>+|-&lt;pkgpath&gt;</h4>
<p>To specify which classes are included, use +pkgpath to add pkgpaths to be
scanned and -pkgpath to exclude sub-pkgpaths of these. You MUST specify at least
one +pkgpath option to specify which pkgpath to include, otherwise Japize could
happily scan through all the zipfiles and directories but not actually process
any of the classes. Since that would be a useless thing to do, japize gives an
error instead.</p>
<p>A "pkgpath" refers to either a package (which includes, by implication, all
sub-packages of it) or a single class. A pkgpath for a package looks like
"com.foo.pkg.sub," and a pkgpath for a class looks like "com.foo.pkg,Cls". The
existence and placement of the comma indicates unambiguously which type of path
is intended.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, it's a pain to have to put in commas in names that
are familiar with dots instead, and get the comma placement exactly right. For
this reason, japize accepts pkgpaths containing only dots, and lets you tell it
what to make of those names. The interpretation of "a.b.c" as a pkgpath depends
on whether you specified apis, explicitly, byname, packages, or classes.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>apis</dt>
  <dd>a.b.c is tried both as a package <i>and</i> a class. This will always do
      what you want (which is why apis is described as the safe default) but at
      the expense of possibly doing extra unnecessary processing trying to find
      the wrong thing.</dd>
  <dt>explicitly</dt>
  <dd>pkgpaths of the form a.b.c are illegal - you must use the explicit
      form.</dd>
  <dt>byname</dt>
  <dd>a.b.c will be processed as a package if "c" starts with a lowercase
      letter, or as a class if it starts with an uppercase one. This usually
      does what you want but fails on things like org.omg.CORBA.
  <dt>packages</dt>
  <dd>a.b.c will be processed as a package. If processing for a class is needed,
      it must be specified explicitly.</dd>
  <dt>classes</dt>
  <dd>a.b.c will be processed as a class. If processing for a package is needed,
      it must be specified explicitly.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>As an example, Sun's
JDK 1.1 includes classes in java.awt.peer and in java.text.resources that are
not part of the public API, even though they are public classes; however, every
other class in the java.* package hierarchy is part of the public API. The
syntax to construct a useful jdk11.japi.gz would therefore be:</p>
<pre>$ japize as jdk11 apis classes.zip +java -java.awt.peer -java.text.resources</pre>
<p>Note that since all pkgpath arguments here are packages, you could save a
small amount of processing by doing this instead:</p>
<pre>$ japize as jdk11 packages classes.zip +java -java.awt.peer -java.text.resources</pre>
<p>or even this:</p>
<pre>$ japize as jdk11 explicitly classes.zip +java, -java.awt.peer, -java.text.resources,</pre>
<p>Another example, this time doing the same thing for kaffe:</p>
<pre>$ japize as kaffe packages $KAFFEHOME/share/kaffe/Klasses.jar $KAFFEHOME/share/kaffe/rmi.jar +java -java.awt.peer -java.text.resources</pre>
<h4><a name="japicompat">japicompat</a></h4>
<p>Next, you can perform the test for compatibility between these two files:</p>
<pre>
$ japicompat jdk11.japi.gz kaffe.japi.gz
</pre>
<p>The full list of flags supported by japicompat is as follows:</p>
<pre>japicompat [-svqhtjw] [-o &lt;outfile&gt;] [-i &lt;ignorefile&gt;] &lt;original api&gt; &lt;api to check&gt;</pre>
<p>The meanings of these options are as follows:</p>
<h4>-s</h4>
<p>By default, japicompat tests for binary compatibility as defined by the JLS,
plus a couple of additions (see below for details). You can turn off these
additions by passing the -s flag to japicompat, for example:</p>
<pre>
$ japicompat -s jdk11.japi.gz kaffe.japi.gz
</pre>
<p>The s stands for "sun", "standard", "specification", or if you like more
colorful language, "single-buttocked" (one buttock=half an...). See "What exactly
does japicompat test?" below for exactly what tests get turned off by this
flag.</p>

<h4>-v</h4>
<p>By default, japicompat only checks for errors that break binary compatibility.
However, japicompat can also check for some "minor" compatibility problems. To
activate these additional checks, use the "-v" flag. The v stands for "verbose".</p>
<pre>
$ japicompat -v jdk11.japi.gz kaffe.japi.gz
</pre>
<p>Specifically, the -v flag enables the following additional checks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SerialVersionUID checking: japicompat reports a minor error if a Serializable
      class has a different SerialVersionUID between the two releases.</li>
  <li>Deprecation checking: japicompat reports a minor error if a class or member
      was deprecated in the original API but is not deprecated in the API being
      checked.</li>
</ul>

<h4>-q</h4>
<p>By default, japicompat provides progress reports as it runs. In unix
terminology, these are sent to stderr (the actual results are sent to
stdout unless the -o flag is used). The -q flag turns off these
progress reports - only real errors will be sent to stderr.</p>

<h4>-h</h4>
<p>Generate output in HTML format. The HTML files produced depend on the
japi.css file in the design directory to get attractive presentation.</h>

<h4>-t</h4>
<p>Generate output in text format. This is the default.</p>

<h4>-j</h4>
<p>Generate output in raw machine readable form. The format produced is called
"japio" format, and by convention should be saved with a ".japio" file extension.
The standalone japiotext and japiohtml utilities can be used to convert this
format into html or text (actually, japicompat calls japiotext or japiohtml
internally if the -h or -t flags are used). Japio files can also be used with
the -i flag to support ignoring errors caused by incompatibilities between
JDK versions.</p>

<h4>-w</h4>
<p>By default japicompat will produce warnings if run against japi files
originally generated by older versions of japitools that had known bugs that
japifix cannot eliminate. Use the -w flag to turn off these warnings, or better
yet, generate your japi files with the latest version ;)</p>

<h4>-o &lt;outfile&gt;</h4>
<p>Send the output to &lt;outfile&gt; instead of stdout. The format of this file
depends on the -h, -t and -j flags.</p>

<h4>-i &lt;ignorefile&gt;</h4>
<p>Suppose you are attempting to implement the Java API. You have (pretty much)
completed coverage of the early JDK versions (1.0 and 1.1) but still have some distance
to achieve full coverage of 1.4 (this is an accurate description of all Free
Software Java implementations at the time of writing). Using japicompat to compare
your implementation with JDK 1.4 gives accurate results, but you might also want to
show your coverage of the earlier versions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Sun has not followed their own binary compatibility rules between
JDK releases, let alone the expanded rules that japicompat tests for. So when you
run a comparison between JDK 1.1 and your implementation, you will get spurious
error reports when you're compatible with 1.4 but not 1.1.</p>
<p>Obviously what you really want is to ignore errors like this, and japicompat
provides a way to do so. First, run a comparison between 1.1 and 1.4 using the
-j switch. Then run the comparison between 1.1 and your implementation, passing
the "-i" option with the output of the previous run. For example:</p>
<pre>
$ japicompat -jvo ignore-11-14.japio jdk11.japi.gz jdk14.japi.gz
$ japicompat -hvo jdk11-myimpl.html -i ignore-11-14.japio jdk11.japi.gz myimpl.japi.gz
</pre>
<p>(In this example I also passed the -v flag but didn't pass -s. You should use
the same combination of these two flags for both runs of japicompat to avoid getting
bad results)</p>
<p>You can also get the same effect by running:</p>
<pre>
$ japicompat -hvo jdk11-myimpl.html -i jdk14.japi.gz jdk11.japi.gz myimpl.japi.gz
</pre>
<p>This is obviously simpler and quicker to type, but requires the comparison
between jdk11 and jdk14 to be run every single time. Making the japio file
manually allows for it to be saved and used again the next time, which lets
japicompat run about twice as fast.</p>
<h4>&lt;original api&gt; &lt;api to check&gt;</h4>
<p>The japi files corresponding to the APIs to be compared.</p>
<p>japicompat specifically tests that the second argument is
backwardly-compatible with the first. Therefore, a perfect implementation of
JDK 1.1 would produce no errors regardless of the order of the arguments, but a
perfect implementation of JDK1.1 plus <em>parts</em> of JDK1.2 should be tested as
follows:</p>
<pre>$ japicompat jdk11.japi.gz myimpl.japi.gz
$ japicompat myimpl.japi.gz jdk12.japi.gz</pre>
<p>It is probably impossible to make an implementation that passes both these
tests, since Sun's own JDK1.2 produces numerous errors when tested against
JDK1.1. See the discussion of the -i option above for a way to cope with this
situation.</p>
<p>Either compressed (.japi.gz) or uncompressed (.japi) files can be passed to
japicompat: The file extension is used to determine whether or not to pipe input
through gzip or not.</p>

<h3>What exactly does japicompat test?</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, japicompat tests for binary compatibility as defined
by Sun in the JLS. A full summary of what does and does not break binary
compatibility according to Sun is <a href="jcompat.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, japicompat also performs some checks that are not specified by the
JLS, for the simple reason that I believe the JLS is wrong to omit them. You can
omit these four extra checks by passing the "-s" flag to japicompat, although
I'm not sure why you would want to...</p>
<p>The specific checks that I believe the JLS should include are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Adding an exception to the throws clause of a method or constructor
    violates binary compatibility</i>, because a class calling that method may
    not catch or specify the newly thrown exception. The JLS claims that the
    VM does not perform any checks on thrown exceptions; I hope this has
    changed because it makes it trivially easy to write a method that throws
    any exception you like without specifying it.</li>
<li><i>Removing an exception from the throws clause of a method or constructor
    violates binary compatibility</i>, because a subclass may be overriding
    the method and throwing the exception. This only applies to non-final
    methods, but it is worth enforcing this rule for all methods and
    constructors because otherwise it is possible to break source code
    compatibility by rendering code in a catch block unreachable.</li>
<li><i>Adding a method to an interface violates binary compatibility</i>,
    because a class that implemented the original version of the interface
    may not implement the newly added method.</li>
<li><i>Adding an abstract method to an abstract class violates binary
    compatibility</i>, because a concrete class derived from the original
    version may not provide a concrete implementation of the new method.
</ul>


<h3>File format</h3>
<p>The file format of .japi files is described in full in
<a href="japi-spec.txt">the japi file format specification</a>. This document
should provide enough information to write a japi file fully compatible with
those produced by japize. This spec can also be found in the tarball as
design/japi-spec.txt.</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<h3>To do</h3>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of what still needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle the new constructs in JDK 1.5 (or 5.0 or whatever it's called),
    particularly generics.</li>
<li>Fix any bugs that anyone finds...</li>
<li>Handle APIs containing international characters in class/member names, and
    also international characters in final constant Strings.</li>
<li>Make a "1.0" release.</li>
</ul>
