This is a temporary README file for the sake of getting *something* together
fast. Full instructions can be found in the web/index.html file, or at
http://rainbow.netreach.net/~sballard/japi/ .

You can unpack the tarball and use the files in the bin/ directory directly or
via symlinks: they can find the java libraries, when necessary, by relative
pathnames. The tarball comes with the java code precompiled so you don't need
to build before use, but if you do any hacking, "make" in the root japi/
directory will rebuild the java code. There's no "make install" but if you copy
everything from bin/ to $prefix/bin and everything in share/java to
$prefix/share/java, everything will continue to work. Sorry, the build system is
spartan!

As of japitools 0.8.7 there is an alternative build system using ant, kindly
provided by Brian Jones. Since I (Stuart) know nothing about ant, I'll assume
that people who do know ant will know exactly what to do with the build.xml file
he provided :)

Japitools assumes that perl is /usr/bin/perl, "gzip" is in your path, and your
preferred java runtime is "java" in your path. gzip is not required if you
work with uncompressed japi files (see the "unzip" option in the japize
documentation). Japize requires a Java runtime with some JDK1.2 features: mostly
the Collections classes. At the time of writing, Kaffe is not sufficient (it
fails to implement TreeSet.subSet) but there have been reports of varying
degrees of success using Kissme and gcc's gij.

Compilation and running of the serialize tool requires GNU getopt,
http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html, GPL, and
JSX, http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~bren/JSX/, GPL.

Fixes are welcomed, and I'll be improving the docs over time.
