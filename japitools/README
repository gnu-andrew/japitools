This is a temporary README file for the sake of getting *something* together
fast. Full instructions can be found at http://stuart.wuffies.net/japi/ .

You can use the jarball directly in your classpath, because the class files in
net/ are precompiled and ready. Alternatively, if you want to do any hacking,
just unpack the jarball and use "make" in the root of the jarball to compile
the source code. Sorry, the build system is spartan!

This code requires jode-1.1.1.jar to also be in your classpath unless you use
the "reflect" option, which isn't recommended. Also, Japize requires at least
JDK1.2, although Jode is perfectly capable of loading previous versions of
Java to Japize them.

Fixes are welcomed, and I'll be improving the docs over time.
