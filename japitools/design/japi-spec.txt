This document specifies the format of a .japi file, version 0.9.1. The actual
implementations of japize, japifix and japicompat may not honor this spec
exactly. If they do not, it is generally a bug or missing feature in the tool;
this spec notes such bugs when they are known.

The first line of any japi file since version 0.8.1 is as follows:
%%japi <version>[ <info>]
<version> indicates the version number of the japi file format. While this
version number vaguely correlates with the version number of japitools releases,
it is not the same number. Often japitools releases do not require a file format
change, and sometimes I mess with the file version number for other reasons,
with mixed results. <info> is currently reserved for future expansion and should
be omitted when creating japi files, but should be parsed and ignored when
reading a japi file. The format of this line is guaranteed to remain the same
through all future japi versions.

For completeness, I should mention file format versions prior to 0.8.1. Version
0.7 can be recognized by the following regular expression:
  /^[^ ]+#[^ ]* (public|protected) (abstract|concrete) (static|instance) (final|nonfinal) /
Version 0.8 can be recognized by the following regular expression:
  /^[^ ]+#[^ ]* [Pp][ac][si][fn] /
These version numbers were invented retroactively, of course :)

The format of all other lines in a japi file is as follows:
<pkg>,<class>[$<innerclass>]!<member> <modifiers> <typeinfo>
