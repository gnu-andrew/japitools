Requirements:

- Include summary information sufficient to generate output equivalent to what
  we have now.
- Include the actual error messages in a form sufficient to filter by them,
  much like the current internal format.

Format:

%%japio 0.9.1 <origfile>@<date> <newfile>@<date>
<linetype> <rest>
...

<date> is optional, but if present should be in the format
       yyyy/mm/dd_hh:mm:ss_TZ

<linetype> determines the format of the rest of the line. Possibilities
are:

categories =a b c ...
  This indicates all the categories that will be included in this japio file.
  The usual categories line would look something like:
    categories =good =svuid bad missing abs.add
  The "=" in front of good and svuid indicates that these values are considered
  "okay"; for example, in japiohtml, a package with 85% good and 5% svuid will
  get the ok-90pct CSS class.
  Any name can appear in this list, and all names are optional, but the name
  "good" is special: it implies there are *no* actual errors associated with
  it. In the future this will perhaps be expressed in the categories line, eg
  "==good".

rawsummary <pkg> <category>:<count> <category>:<count> ...
  eg:
  rawsummary java.lang good:934 bad:46 missing:11 +abs.add:3
  This indicates that of 934+46+11 tested API items in java.lang, 934 were
  good, 46 bad, and 11 missing, and that additionally, 3 items were "abs.add".
  The "+" before abs.add indicates that it should not be counted towards the
  total count, so the totals of good+bad+missing equate to 100% and abs.add is
  an extra few percent. The names can be anything but must be listed in the
  "categories" line, which must appear before any rawsummary lines.
  A rawsummary line should be emitted for every package processed, and
  additionally for the special package # (everything). These numbers
  indicate "raw" data: it is not expected that every error should correspond
  one-to-one with the bad/missing counts. Rather, it is expected that the
  numbers should be weighted in such a way that interpreting them as percentages
  is as meaningful as possible.

error <etype> <itemtype> <pkg>,<class>!<member> <sups> <was>/<is>
  <etype> is a category name such as "bad", "missing" or "abs.add". Again, it
  must have appeared in the categories line.
  <itemtype> is one of "package", "class", "interface", "field", "method" or
  "constructor".
  <pkg>, <class> and <member> are rendered just like in a japi file, and must
  correspond to the itemtype given. A package is rendered as java.lang,!
  <sups> is a list of all superclasses and superinterfaces of the class, colon
  separated. This field can be omitted entirely, eg for a package or for
  java.lang.Object, in which case there will be two consecutive spaces between
  <member> and <was>.
  <was> and <is> describe the substance of the error, by specifying
  what the item "is" compared to what it "was" in the old file. For example,
  a method that has illegally changed from static to instance would have a <was>
  of "static" and an <is> of "instance". <was> can be left empty for errors
  where the <is> gives all the information you need (for example, if <is> is
  "missing"). Both <was> and <is> can contain any character, including spaces,
  but / and \ need to be backslash-escaped. The only hard-and-fast rules for the
  choices of <was> and <is> are that <was> and <is> cannot be the same, and that
  they have to be interchangeable: if the same error would apply in a reverse
  comparison, the resulting line must be the same with <was> and <is> swapped.
  Some other examples:
  instance/static
  constant [foo]/nonconstant
  constant [foo]/constant [bar]
  /a new abstract method
  nonfinal/final
  concrete/abstract
